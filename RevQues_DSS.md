20. **Design a simply supported beam of effective span 4 m that is laterally supported throughout. It carries a total uniformly distributed load of 35 kN including its self weight. Using steel of grade Fe 410, design the beam.**

21. **Calculate the strength and efficiency of the lap joint shown in the figure. The bolts are 20 mm in diameter and of grade 4.6. The two plates to be jointed are 10 & 12 mm thick. Assume Fe 410 grade of steel.**

22. **Determine the block shear strength of the welded tension member as shown in the figure. Assume steel of grade to be Fe 410.**

23. **Calculate the strength of a discontinuous strut of length 3.2 m. The strut consists of two unequal angles 100 x 75 x 8 mm of grade Fe 410 with long legs connected and placed on the same side of the gusset plate.**

24. **Determine the safe load P that can be carried by the joint shown. The bolts used are 20 mm diameter of grade 4.8. The thickness of flange of I-section is 9.1 mm and that of bracket plate is 10 mm.**

25. **Design and draw channel section purlin for a roof truss of an industrial building for the given data: Span of truss = 6.0 m, Spacing of truss = 3.0 m c/c, Inclination of roof = 30°, Spacing of purlins = 2.0 m c/c, Wind pressure = 1.5 kN/m², Roof coverage- A.C. sheets weighing 200 N/m².**

27. **Design a gusseted base for a column ISHB 350 @72.4 kg/m with flange plates 450 × 20mm carrying a factored axial force of 3000kN. The column rests on M20 grade concrete pedestal. Design the bolted connection also. Assume Fe 410 grade steel and 4.6 grade bolts.**

28. **Design a bolted bracket connection (in plane) to support an end reaction of 500kN due to the factored loads supported by the beam. The eccentricity of the end reaction is 200 mm. The steel used is of grade Fe410 and bolts are of 20mm diameter, grade 4.6. The thickness of bracket plate may be taken as 10 mm. The column section is ISHB200 @366N/m.**

29. **Design a purlin on a sloping roof truss with the dead load of 0.15 kN/m², a live load of 2.5 kN/m² and a wind load of 0.6 kN/m² (suction). The purlins are 1.8m centre to centre and a span of 3.8m, simply supported on a rafter at a slope of 20°.**
